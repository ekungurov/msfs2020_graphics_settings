|  0 | anti aliasing                | TAA (mid range), DLSS:DLAA (high end)                                                                | No impact on CPU performance. Off gives 22.7 FPS FXAA, DLAA gives 22.3 FPS (1.7% reduction) TAA gives 21.6 FPS (5% reduction)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Geometry aliasing is visible in motion on Off, FXAA, and DLAA, which is not present in TAA. Running <100 Render Scaling with TAA enabled reconstructs the image to native resolution, netting the performance impact that would come with a lower resolution but the image quality similar to a higher resolution.  I highly reccomend using TAA as it helps denoise Ambient Occlusion and Reflections.                                                                                                                                                |

Under a CPU bottlenecked scenario, 10 at 105 FPS 100 at 81 FPS (30% reduction) 200 at 68.5 FPS (53% reduction) Under a GPU bottlenecked scenario, 10 at 24.2 FPS 100 at 22.1 FPS (10% reduction) 200 at 21.4 FPS (13% reduction)                                                                                                                                                     | Linear quality increase up to 100, but going past 100 leads to lower framerates with smaller visual impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Some people reported that Ultra is unusable for them, so if it makes things worse for you, switch to High                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No other visual impact aside reducing stutters on Ultra. This setting seems to affect how terrain details are loaded and kept in memory while your plane is moving.    |
|  2 | terrain vector data *        | Ultra* To be tested at a later date.

Low has very barebones buildings. Medium adds clutter / objects to buildings based on distance. High and Ultra increase those distances, and also improve the shading on the buildings. Please note that Ultra could have major perofrmance hit in some cases so use it only if you have plenty of horsepower                                                                                                                                                                             |

Low looks flat / billboard like. Medium makes the trees look significantly more lush and 3D. High adds more trees. Ultra adds even more trees, but you probably won't notice the difference without comparing two screenshots side by side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
