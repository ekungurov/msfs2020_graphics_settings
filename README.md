Off gives 22.7 FPS FXAA, DLAA gives 22.3 FPS (1.7% reduction) TAA gives 21.6 FPS (5% reduction)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | New TAA introduced with Update 5 has a larger performance impact - FXAA and DLAA seem to have some severe post processing / coloration issues  Geometry aliasing is visible in motion on Off, FXAA, and DLAA, which is not present in TAA. Running <100 Render Scaling with TAA enabled reconstructs the image to native resolution, netting the performance impact that would come with a lower resolution but the image quality similar to a higher resolution.  I highly reccomend using TAA as it helps denoise Ambient Occlusion and Reflections. |
